1
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,025
the whole Spinoza

2
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:12,158
was a 17th century Dutch philosopher who
tried to reinvent

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,927
religion moving it away from something
based on superstition

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,090
and ideas have direct divine
intervention to being a discipline

5
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:23,024
that was going to be far more impersonal
Quays I scientific

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,033
and yet also at times serenely consoling

7
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,048
the whole the word means blessed in
hebrew

8
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:32,071
was born in the Jewish quarter Amsterdam
in 1632

9
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:36,360
a thriving central Jewish commerce in
thought his ancestors were sephardic

10
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:37,550
jews

11
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:40,094
who'd fled the Spanish Peninsula
following the Catholic conspired

12
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:41,813
expulsion in 1492

13
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,758
the whole house studios highly
intelligent child received an intense

14
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,734
the traditional Jewish education

15
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,960
he went to the local church school the
issue for and followed all the Jewish

16
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,725
High Holidays and rituals

17
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:57,690
the gradually he began to distance
himself from the fate of his ancestors

18
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,074
although I have been educated from
boyhood in the accepted beliefs

19
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,218
concerning scripture

20
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:06,060
he later wrote with characteristic
caution I felt bound

21
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:10,075
in the end to embrace of the views is
fully fleshed-out views

22
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:13,170
would be expressed his great work the
ethics written entirely in Latin

23
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,011
and published in 1677 in the ethics
Spinoza directly challenge the main

24
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,075
tenets have two days in particular

25
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:24,135
and organized religion in general God is
not a person who stands outside of

26
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:25,093
nature

27
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:28,112
there is no one to hear our prayers or
to create miracles

28
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:32,060
or to punish us for misdeeds the is no
afterlife

29
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,085
man is not God's chosen creature the
Bible was only written by

30
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:39,115
ordinary people got is not craftsman or
an architect in or easy a

31
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:44,060
King more military strategist to calls
for believers to take up the Holy sold

32
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:47,017
God doesn't see anything notice expect
anything

33
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:51,082
he doesn't charge he doesn't even reward
the virtuous with the life after death

34
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:54,147
every representation of court as a
person is a projection of the

35
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:55,132
imagination

36
00:01:56,032 --> 00:02:00,053
and everything in the traditional
liturgical calendar is pure superstition

37
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,057
and mumbo-jumbo

38
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:05,139
however despite all this remarkably
Spinoza did not declare himself an

39
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:06,104
atheist

40
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:10,096
he insisted that he remained a staunch
defender of gold

41
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:13,102
go to place an absolutely central role
in Spinoza's ethics

42
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:18,023
but it isn't anything like the gold who
wants a pages of the Old Testament

43
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:21,084
Spinoza's gordy's holy impersonal and
indistinguishable from what we might

44
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:21,175
variously called

45
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,166
nature or existence or a world soul
gorgeous the universe and its laws

46
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,071
gold is reason and truth gold is the
animating force in

47
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:34,048
everything that is and can be he is not
in time

48
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:37,059
and he cannot be individual eated
Spinoza rights

49
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:42,071
whatever he is is in gold and nothing
can exist will be conceived without got

50
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:45,169
throughout his text Spinoza was keen to
undermine the idea of

51
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,118
prayer in prayer an individual appeals
to God

52
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:53,050
to change the way the universe works but
spinners

53
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:57,040
argues that this is entirely the wrong
way around the task of human beings

54
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:01,089
is to try to understand how and why the
universe works the way it does

55
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:04,157
and then accept it rather than protest
at the workings existence

56
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:09,063
by sending little messages up into the
sky Espinosa put it beautifully but

57
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,019
rather coarse thickly

58
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,025
who so ever love scored cannot strive
that cord

59
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,088
should love him in return in other words
only it deeply distorted and

60
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:22,130
infantile narcissism would lead someone
that wants to believe in court

61
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,029
and then to imagine that this Court
would take an interest in bending the

62
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,062
rules have existence

63
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:31,144
to improve his or her life in some way
Spinoza was deeply influenced by the

64
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,109
philosophy of the Stoics have ancient
Greece and Rome

65
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:39,018
they had argued the wisdom lies not in
protest against how things are

66
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,056
but in continuous attempts to understand
the ways of the world

67
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:46,205
and then power down peacefully to
necessity Seneca

68
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,470
spinners as favorite philosopher had
compared human beings two dogs on a

69
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:50,053
leash

70
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:54,085
being led by the necessities of life in
a range of directions

71
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:58,086
the movement pools against what's
necessary the mall one is strangled

72
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:02,117
and therefore the wise must always
endeavor try to understand ahead of time

73
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:03,115
how things are

74
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:07,057
for example what love is like oh how
politics works

75
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:10,081
and then change the direction
accordingly so as not to be strangled

76
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:11,097
unnecessarily

77
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:16,926
it is this kind of stoic attitude the
constantly pervades Spinoza's philosophy

78
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,120
to understand God traditionally means
studying the Bible in other holy text

79
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:26,036
but Spinoza now introduces another idea
the best way to New called

80
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:29,128
is to understand how life and the
universe work it through knowledge of

81
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,757
psychology philosophy in the natural
sciences

82
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:36,840
the one comes to understand got in
traditional religion

83
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:40,084
believers ask special favors I've got
Spinoza proposes instead

84
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:44,633
that we should understand what God wants
and we can do so in one way above all

85
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,420
by studying everything that he is by
reasoning

86
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,900
we can exceed to redefine tunnel
perspective

87
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,828
Spinoza made a famous distinction
between two ways of looking at life

88
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:59,150
we can I the seed acoustically from our
limited point of view

89
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:02,874
as he put it sub specie jurists Eunice
under the aspect

90
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,043
time all we can look at things globally
and eternally

91
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,590
sub specie attorney Tartus under the
aspect of eternity

92
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,098
on nature means that will always be
divided between the two

93
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,080
Central Life pulls us toward time-bound
partial view

94
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:21,567
but our recent intelligence can give us
unique access to another perspective

95
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,060
it can quite literally allowance and
Hispanics have comes beautifully lyrical

96
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:29,015
to participate in a tunnel totality

97
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:32,034
normally we call back whatever is bad
for ass

98
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,240
and good whatever increases our power an
advantage but Espinosa

99
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:39,099
to be truly ethical means rising above
such local concerns

100
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:43,118
it might all sound for beating but
Spinoza envisage his philosophy

101
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,300
as a route to a life based on freedom
from guilt

102
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:50,092
from sorrow from PT or from shame

103
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,423
happiness involves lining all-wheel with
that of the universe

104
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,590
the universe gold as its own projects
and its our task

105
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:01,062
to understand rather than rail against
these

106
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:05,391
three-person is one conscious if the
necessities that compel a school

107
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,770
Spinoza rights the wise man the person
who understands how when why things

108
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:14,566
are possesses eternally true complacency
of spirit

109
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,293
needless to say these ideas cool Spinoza
into

110
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,687
very deep trouble he was excommunicated
from the Jewish community from saddam in

111
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,498
1656

112
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,270
the rabbis issued a richness sure am

113
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:29,045
hence the philosopher it went by the
decree of the

114
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:33,052
angels and by the commander the holy man
we excommunicate expel curse

115
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:37,079
and damn hawked Espinosa with all the
classes which are written in the book at

116
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,112
all

117
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:42,100
cusick be here by day and cusick be here
by night custody he when he lies down

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,015
and custody he when he rises up Espinoza
was forced to flee Amsterdam

119
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:50,056
and eventually settled in the hague
where he lived quietly and peacefully as

120
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:50,155
a lens grinder

121
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:55,116
and private tutor to his death in 1677
spinners his work was lucky for gotten

122
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:56,112
down the ages

123
00:06:57,012 --> 00:07:00,030
Hagel took an interest as it could
consign and several other twentieth

124
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,020
century philosophers

125
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:04,106
but from many perspectives Spinoza's
work constitutes cool warning

126
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:08,082
about failures a philosophy the ethics
is one of the world's most beautiful

127
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:08,164
books

128
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:12,095
it contains a calming perspective for
storing take on life

129
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:16,097
it replaces the Qatar superstition with
a wise and consoling pantheism

130
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:20,079
and yet Spinoza's work failed utterly to
convince any but a few

131
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,138
to abandon traditional religion and to
move towards a rationalist

132
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,039
why system of belief the reasons are no
way

133
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,043
simple and banal Spinoza fail to
understand

134
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:33,135
like so many philosophers before and
since that will lead people to religion

135
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,043
isn't just a reason

136
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:38,046
but far more importantly emotion belief
fear

137
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,092
tradition people stick with the police
because they like the ritual the

138
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:42,095
communal meals

139
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,176
the yearly traditions the beautiful
architecture to music and the lovely

140
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:48,079
language without and cynical court
church

141
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:53,051
Spinoza's ethics arguably contains a
whole lot more wisdom than the Bible

142
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:56,073
because it comes without any the Bible
supporting structure

143
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:59,106
it remains a marginal work studied here
and there

144
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:03,008
universities in the West what the
traditional religion

145
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:06,009
that Spinoza thought outmoded in the 16
seventies

146
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,035
continues to thrive and convince people
if we're

147
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:12,120
ever to replace traditional beliefs we
must remember just how much religion is

148
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:13,076
helped along

149
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:16,113
by ritual tradition art and a desire to
belong

150
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:20,014
all things that Spinoza despite its
great wisdom

151
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:23,108
ignored it is peril in his bold attempt
to replace the Bible
